# **LEARNING PYTORCH**

Here is my learning process of learning PyTorch for Deep Learning and Computer Vision. This is to continue and strengthen my previous learning results at the Indonesia AI - Computer Vision Specialist Bootcamp. The following are some of my learning resources:

1. Bootcamp at Indonesia AI - Computer Vision Specialist (https://aiforindonesia.com/)
2. Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning (https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning)
3. Modern Computer Vision with PyTorch (https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Modern-Computer-Vision-with-PyTorch)
